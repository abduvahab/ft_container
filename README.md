# ft_containers 

## About

Ft_containers is a project of the mandatory part of the cursus.
It's only made in C++ and was about recoding some containers from the STL.

In order to succeed, a good comprehension of how **templates**, **iterators**, **containers** and 
**algorithms** work was necessary. Of course, STL is not allowed. That means 
you cannot use \<iterator\> or even \<utility\>.
